    <h2>My Experience</h2>

    <p>1. Python</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. C</p>
    <br>

    <p>5. MySQL</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am currently undertaking an offline internship in Web Development at IIFON, Kolkata. 
        This opportunity has allowed me to apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios, work collaboratively in a professional 
        environment, and deepen my understanding of full-stack development. From designing responsive user interfaces to optimizing 
        backend functionalities, this experience is helping me grow both as a developer and as a problem-solver, while contributing 
        meaningfully to the organization's digital initiatives.</p>
