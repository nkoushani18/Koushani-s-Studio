    <h2>Hello Everyone...I'm Koushani Nath</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet — where ideas come to life, code turns into creation, and imagination meets innovation.

I'm not just another tech enthusiast; I'm a storyteller who speaks in logic, design, and curiosity. Whether it's crafting intuitive interfaces, bringing characters to life in 3D worlds, or breathing intelligence into machines, I thrive where creativity and technology collide.

Every project I take on is a piece of me — fueled by late-night brainstorming, fueled by coffee (or chai!), and driven by the excitement of solving real-world problems with elegant solutions.

So go ahead, explore my work, peek into my process, and if something sparks your interest — let's create something unforgettable.</p>
