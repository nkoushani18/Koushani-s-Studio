# 🎨 Koushani's Studio

> **“Every pixel tells a story. Welcome to mine.”**

---

🌟 **Koushani’s Studio** is my personal portfolio website — a digital space where I present who I am, what I’ve done, and where I’m headed. Originally a simple HTML-based site, it now includes CSS styling and ongoing improvements. This is a living project that will continue to grow with me.

## 🏠 Home Page

The main page (`index.html`) serves as a gateway to:

* 📌 **Introduction** – Get to know who I am and what I stand for.
* 🎓 **Education** – A look into my academic journey.
* 💼 **Experience** – Insights into my professional path so far.
* 📬 **Contact Me** – Reach out, collaborate, or just say hello.

All pages are handcrafted with HTML and styled with CSS to enhance the user experience.
