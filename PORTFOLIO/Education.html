    <h2>Hey there, These are my educational qualifications</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My academic journey began at Auxilium Convent School, Barasat, Kolkata, where I built a strong foundation from nursery 
        to Class 10 in a nurturing and value-driven environment. I then pursued my higher secondary education at Sudhir Memorial 
        Institute, Madhyamgram, Kolkata, where I explored my academic interests more deeply and developed a clear vision for my future. 
        Currently, I am in my third year at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Chennai, where I’m pursuing my 
        undergraduate degree. This phase has been a dynamic blend of technical learning, hands-on projects, and personal 
        growth — shaping me into a curious, creative, and solution-oriented individual.</p>
